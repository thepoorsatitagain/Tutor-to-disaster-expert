# Disaster Response Guide

## EARTHQUAKE

### During the Earthquake
1. **DROP** - Get down on hands and knees
2. **COVER** - Get under sturdy furniture, protect head and neck
3. **HOLD ON** - Stay in position until shaking stops

**If no furniture available:**
- Move to interior wall, away from windows
- Cover head and neck with arms
- Stay away from exterior walls, windows, heavy objects

**If outdoors:**
- Move to open area away from buildings, power lines, trees
- Drop and cover until shaking stops

**If in a vehicle:**
- Pull over to clear area (away from bridges, overpasses, buildings, power lines)
- Stay in vehicle with seatbelt on until shaking stops

### After the Earthquake
1. Expect aftershocks - be ready to DROP, COVER, HOLD ON again
2. Check yourself and others for injuries
3. Check for hazards: gas leaks (smell), electrical damage, structural damage
4. If smell gas: open windows, leave immediately, do NOT use flames or electrical switches
5. Do NOT use elevators
6. Stay out of damaged buildings
7. If trapped: tap on pipe or wall (rescuers listen for this), do NOT shout (conserve energy, avoid dust)

**WARNING: Earthquake near coast = TSUNAMI RISK**
If you feel strong shaking near the ocean: Move to high ground immediately. Do not wait for official warning.

## WATER SAFETY AND PURIFICATION

### When Water May Be Contaminated
- After flooding
- After earthquakes (pipe damage)
- During disease outbreaks
- When color, smell, or taste is unusual

### Purification Methods

**Boiling (most reliable):**
1. Bring water to rolling boil
2. Continue boiling for 1 minute (3 minutes at high altitude)
3. Let cool naturally
4. Improve taste by pouring between containers

**Bleach (if boiling not possible):**
- Use plain household bleach (no additives, 5-6% sodium hypochlorite)
- 8 drops per gallon of clear water (16 drops if cloudy)
- Stir and let stand 30 minutes
- Should have slight chlorine smell (if not, repeat and wait 15 more minutes)

**Solar Disinfection (SODIS):**
- For clear water only
- Fill clear plastic bottles (remove labels)
- Expose to direct sunlight for minimum 6 hours (2 days if cloudy)
- Works best with small bottles (2L or less)
