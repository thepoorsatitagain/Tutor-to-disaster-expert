Expert-in-a-Box V2: The Dual-Mode Asset
The Concept: A Sleeping Giant
Most disaster tech fails because it sits in a warehouse for five years, loses its charge, or the staff forgets how to use it. Expert-in-a-Box V2 solves this by being useful every single day.
Mode 1: The Educational Assistant (Steady State) In normal times, it’s a standard, offline educational tool. It helps a 5th grader with math or a local clinic with basic medical records. It builds trust, stays charged, and stays "in the loop."
Mode 2: The Disaster Relief Agent (Triggered State) When a crisis hits—an earthquake, a civil collapse, or a "expertise desert" scenario—the admin activates the Remote Access Override (RAO) or swaps the Expert Pack. The device "wakes up" with high-level triage, structural engineering, or emergency logistics capabilities.
Architecture: The "Clean Room" Protocol
The core of this system is Statelessness. To ensure safety and reduce liability, the device operates on a strict "Clean Room" cycle.
Inject: An Expert Pack is unzipped into a local, hardened workspace. This module contains the mission-specific knowledge and the Admin Toggles that set the safety rails.
Verify: A Worker/Auditor Pipeline executes all tasks. The Worker provides the expertise; the Auditor checks it against the admin-set policy. Neither model has "agency"—they are tools following a script.
Wipe: Once the session is closed, the system exports an encrypted Audit ZIP (the "Black Box") and performs an atomic wipe of the workspace.
Design Principles
Mission-Agnostic: We don't build the "Expertise." We build the Capacity. Whether the device is a math tutor or a field surgeon is determined by the Admin who finances the device.
Hardened Local Service: No Chrome. No Cloud. No Internet, No Problem: It runs Llama 3 (or equivalent) on local hardware.
Variable Enforcement: Every safety option is a toggle set by the admin. These can be overridden with Keyed Tiers (Keys/Passwords), shifting the liability from the donor to the operator when high-risk decisions are required.
Persona Snagging: Uses QR codes or Bluetooth to quickly ingest "Persona Stubs" (Who, What, How). This adjusts the output for the operator's education level without granting them new permissions. Or alternately Persona stubs can be input manually. 
Why This Matters 
This is building Digital Infrastructure, not just "AI." It’s designed to be prepositioned by organizations like the Gates Foundation or local governments.
Liability Shield: The "Clean Room" wipe and Audit Trail prove exactly what the AI said and which safety toggles were active.
Resilience: It functions when the internet is gone and the "experts" haven't arrived yet.
Status
Governance Model: Grounded in a multi-layered policy architecture (filed in provisional patents, Dec 2025).
